# Autodev Loop

Shared development workflow used by project-specific dev skills. No planning step, go straight to implementation.

## Steps

0. **Sync**, checkout main and run `git sync`.

1. **Create a branch** for the feature/fix.

2. **Implement**, follow existing coding style, keep changes minimal.

3. **Add tests**, parameterized, concise, following project conventions.

4. **Verify**, run the project's build and test commands.

5. **Commit** with `git commit -n -m "msg"`, no co-author tags.

6. **PR summary:** Use `/dev-pr-summarize` to generate a changelog.

7. **Checkout main** when done.
